Extaract from same site =>
Make sure 'set csto=0' is included in your vimrc if you are coding C, and 'set csto=1' is included in your vimrc if you are coding C++ (see 'Theory' section above if you want to know why).
Now you are ready to start using it. Simply type ':cs help' to see the commands right there. Type ':tags' to see where you currently are in the tag stack. Finally ':tag' will take you to an arbitrary symbol (and tab-completion works). Try typing ':tag sys_' and the press the Tab key and you should see it try going through several possible completions.
 Usage:
     Control-\ g to find the definition of a variable, 
     Control-\ s to find its occurrence as a symbol in other code
     Control-\ c to see where the symbol is called from. 
     The command 'q:' allows you to edit the command line history so you can paste large identifier names into a 'cs find g' command (Ctrl-C exits 'q:' mode).
